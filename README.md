### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md) 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Project title: What is happiness?
+ This project is conducted by Seungwook Han (sh3264).

+ Project summary: With the HappyDB, a crowdsourced database of 100,000 happy moments, I conduct a brief study on what happiness consists of. This data blog utilizes techniques of text mining, sentiment analysis, and analyzing basic features of the corpus. First, by using sentiment analysis, I identify key emotions that people express in their happy moments. Then, by using unigram and bigram frequency counts, I draw up key events and actions that people frequently partake in and cite as happy moments. The analysis concluded these following interesting understanding of happiness:

1. Surprise is often a positively cited emotion in happy moments.
2. Playing games, watching movies, birthday, and mother seem to be common experiences and objects that factor into happiness.
3. Depending on the length of the reflection period, the descriptors and events for the happy moments can also fluctutate -- the longer the reflection period, perhaps the more abstract the factors are for happiness.
